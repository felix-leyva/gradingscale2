# GradingScale2 App

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, which is built with
Jetbrains Compose Multiplatform. The project is a simple grading scale calculator that allows
users to do the calculations for their grades in the specified grading scales systems.

Not all the grading scales are linear, so the app provides a way to define the grading scale
and do exact calculations based on the user's input.

The projects is WIP and is not yet ready for production use.
